// Write a function named printCombinations that gets an integer num and prints all the possible combinations of numbers from 1 to n having sum n.

// Make sure to print the combinations in specific order and way, check the test cases!

// The printing can be done in a recursive way, if it's not happening in the main recursive function.

// num = 5 --> 1+4, 3+2

function sumCombinations(num) {
  // Write code here
}
