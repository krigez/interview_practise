// The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.

// For example, let's find the GCD of 12 and 18:

// List the factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.
// List the factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18.
// Identify the largest common factor: In this case, it's 6.
// So, GCD(12, 18) = 6. This means 6 is the greatest number that can evenly divide both 12 and 18.

// Write a function to calculate the GCD of two numbers.

// Input: 12, 18
// Output: 6
