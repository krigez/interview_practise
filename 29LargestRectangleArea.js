// Given an array of non-negative integers representing the height of bars in a histogram, find the largest rectangle that can be formed from the histogram.

// Input: [2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3]
// Expected Output: 10 (The largest rectangle is formed by heights 5 and 6)
// Note - The area of this rectangle is calculated as the width (number of bars) times the minimum height of the bars within the rectangle: 2 * min(5, 6) = 2 * 5 = 10.
